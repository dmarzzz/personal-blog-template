# Blog Starter Pack

This repo is built off of [blog-starter](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter) by Vercel which provides a fantastic starting structure for a markdown based blog. This blog starter pack uses Next.js's [Static Generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates) feature and the blog posts are stored in `/_posts` as Markdown files. Adding a new Markdown file in there will create a new blog post!

The two core design constraints I have in a blogging site:
1. Easy to add blog posts
2. Easy to change to whatever aesthetic style I am feeling that month

To do so I have attempted to condense the necessary components into two main files that you can control easily using an LLM:
1. `/src/app/page.tsx` which is the home page and root
2. `/posts/[slug]/page.tsx` which is the blog page
The styles for both of these are defined almost entirely inline using tailwind, with the exception that some high level css properties are defined in `/src/app/globals.css`

## How to Make It Your Own

- [ ] Fork or Clone Into Your Own Repo
- [ ] Modify `BLOG_NAME` and `AUTHOR` in `/src/lib/constants.ts`
- [ ] Modify `primary-color` in `/src/app/globals.css`
- [ ] Add a markdown file to `/_posts` following the header format as seen in `/_posts/sample.md`
- [ ] Replace website icon located at `/public/favicon/favicon.ico`

### How to Modify Home Page Using ChatGPT

Here is an example commit for modifying the home page <example commit>.

1. Decide on how you would like to modify the home page
2. Grab `/src/app/page.tsx` and `/src/app/globals.css`
3. Enter into LLM: "Please modify the following code to have a juicy spectrum from yellow to purple, use a dark blue as the primary color, use comic sans font, and to change it so that the boxes for the posts have no 3D effect and instead have a frosted glass effect. Here is the typescript code <`/src/app/page.tsx`>, the tailwind config <`/tailwind.config.ts`> and the global css file <`/src/app/globals.css`>."
4. Incorporate recommended changes!
